# 🎵 VibeNest

A full-stack music streaming web app where artists upload their music and listeners discover it. Think SoundCloud-style — no Spotify API, everything is self-hosted via Cloudinary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Cloudinary account

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Make sure the frontend's API base URL points to your backend. Update it in your axios config or `.env` if you've set it up.

## Deployment

**Backend → Render**
- Create a new Web Service on Render
- Connect your GitHub repo, set root directory to `backend`
- Add all environment variables from `.env`
- Build command: `npm install` | Start command: `node server.js`

**Frontend → Vercel**
